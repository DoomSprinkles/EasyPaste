# EasyPaste

Sharing code is a good thing, and it should be _really_ easy to do it.
A lot of times, I want to show you something I'm seeing - and that's where we
use pastebins.

EasyPaste is the prettiest, easiest to use pastebin ever made.

## Duration

Pastes will stay for 30 days from their last view.  They may be removed earlier
and without notice.

## Privacy

While the contents are not directly crawled by any search robot
that obeys "robots.txt", there should be no great expectation of privacy. Post
things at your own risk. Not responsible for any loss of data or removed
pastes.

## Open Source

EasyPaste can easily be installed behind your network, and its all open source!
